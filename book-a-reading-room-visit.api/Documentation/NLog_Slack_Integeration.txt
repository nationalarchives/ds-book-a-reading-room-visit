Nlog is used by the KBS API and can be  configured to post to Slack.
This requires the use of a webhook which in turn is owned by an app you create within the Slack workspace
In the tna-digital Slack workspace:
- the app is Kew Booking System App
- webhooks within this app can be retrieved/set at https://api.slack.com/apps/A02DR3E2611/incoming-webhooks?success=1
- the webhook should be configured to post to the ds-kbs-notifications channel
- the webhook can be set as an environment variable in launchsettings.json during development and testing.
- However, webhooks should not be checked into Github as this will result in their being disabled by GitGuardian
