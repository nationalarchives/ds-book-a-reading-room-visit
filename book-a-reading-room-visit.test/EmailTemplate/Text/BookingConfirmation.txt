    Dear {Name},

    You have booked a visit to view original documents in The National Archives’ reading rooms on {VisitStartDateDisplay}.

    Please note: This is a confirmation of your booking, not the availability of the documents you have requested.  Whilst we do our very best to make all documents requested available, there are some instances when documents are unavailable.  In most cases we will arrange to borrow these for your visit but on occasion this may not be possible.  If more than half of your document requests are unavailable we will contact you the day before your visit.

    Your document order has been submitted and we will begin preparing your order for your visit. 
    
    We will be in contact if we have any questions about your visit.

    During your visit, you will be able to order additional documents to view (an additional three documents at a time).
