                    <p>
                        If we invite you to an event or to take part in a survey, we may use a separate organisation to administer the booking or the survey. You will be giving your information directly to them and they will process it, and pass the necessary

                    <p>Data protection legislation gives you various rights over your information. These may include (as relevant) the right to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Access information held about you: you must provide us with valid ID, and with enough information to enable us to identify your personal information. In certain circumstances, under data protection legislation, we may not be required
                            to provide all the details of personal information held. You are only entitled to your own personal data, and not to information relating to other people. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we can
                            request a &ldquo;reasonable fee&rdquo; to deal with the request; or refuse to deal with it. We will provide you with an explanation of this decision.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Amend and rectify personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. If your information is in our archival collection we will not alter the record. It may be to your advantage
                            to have this documentary proof that a government record was incorrect. We will, however, consider adding the correct information to the archival record.

                        <li>
                            Request restriction of information processing concerning you or to object to processing of your personal information.

                            Request the erasure of your personal information where it is no longer necessary for us to retain it.

                        Please see the details in the&nbsp;<a href="#contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;section below if you wish to exercise any rights. We endeavour to acknowledge requests within three working days and to supply the appropriate response and

                    <h2 id="processing">Processing your personal information outside of the EU</h2>
                    <p>
                        All EU countries, including the UK, process personal information according to the General Data Protection regulations, which requires them to have a legal basis for processing it, and gives you rights over your information. Countries
                        outside the EU, although they may have their own Data Protection legislation, will not be subject to the same EU regulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accordingly, we exercise particular care if we need to send your information outside the EU. This ranges from arranging secure methods of transferring it to ensuring that we have a robust contract in place with any third party. If
                        necessary we may send specialist IT staff abroad to inspect and approve the conditions under which your information would be processed.
                    </p>
                    <p>We comply with the government&rsquo;s current policy for off-shoring (processing outside the UK).</p>
                    <p>We will take all practical steps to make sure your personal information is not sent to a country that is not seen as &lsquo;safe&rsquo; either by the UK or EU governments.</p>
                    <p>If you are accessing our services from outside the EU then any information you send or receive from us will, of necessity, be transferred via a non-EU country.</p>
                    <h2 id="keeping">Keeping personal information secure</h2>
                    <p>
                        The National Archives takes the technical and organisational security of all the information it holds very seriously. All our staff receive training in how to handle personal data when they join us and have to take an annual refresher
                        course. We protect your information using varying levels of encryption. We also make sure that any third parties with which we deal have an obligation to keep all personal information they process on our behalf secure.

                    <h2 id="people">People in our archival collections</h2>
                    <p>
                        The National Archives has a statutory obligation to permanently preserve the archives of the government and certain other public and private historic records, as detailed in our public catalogue, and to make them available for use.
                        These are documents (including files, maps, pictures, posters, films and sound recordings in analogue and digital form) that have been produced by central offices of the state and the law courts dating back to medieval times. The
                        National Archives provides advice and guidance to transferring government departments and agencies as to whether these documents are worthy of archival preservation &ndash; that is, whether they have lasting value for the research
                        and understanding of history and the present, or for the protection of legitimate interests of citizens or for purposes of legislation, administration and jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We guarantee access to this archival material while observing the protection of private or public interests. In principle, every person has the right to access the documents in The National Archives upon request. We provide information
                        about the archive material on our&nbsp;

                        Some of the more recent archives we hold contain information about living people: personal information that has been acquired by the organisations &ndash; usually government departments that have transferred their records to The National
                        Archives. Your information will be handled according to the safeguards in data protection legislation for archiving in the public interest. This means that we apply the same standards to handling this information, except that some
                        of your rights have a limited application &ndash; see the<a href="#yourrights">

                        We allow third party publishers to digitise some of our records for online use. We and our publishers make every effort, taking into account the content and condition of the material, to avoid putting personal information online that
                        may cause damage or distress to living individuals. As data processors, our publishers must comply with data protection legislation; in particular, they have a duty to assist you in exercising your rights over your personal information.

                    <p>
                        We, or our publishers, may use automated profiling to calculate when personal information that is closed for a person&rsquo;s lifetime can be made open. To do this we assume a lifespan of 100 years. This may result in information on
                        people who are aged over 100 being made public. If this is the case, please contact The National Archives and we will remove your information from public access.

                    <p>
                        People who use information about living people from the archives have a duty, under data protection legislation, not to use that information in a way which may cause distress or damage to them. You should also be aware that, just because
                        information is in the public domain, it does not necessarily make it lawful for you to make it public. Personal information is not covered by the Open Government Licence and may also be subject to copyright.&nbsp;
